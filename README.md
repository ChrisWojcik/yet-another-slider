# Yet Another Slider

This is my slider. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Not responsive,
fixed width...but it works. People wouldn't believe that I'd used jQuery if I 
hadn't made one. Hopefully it will be of use as a code sample to people who want
to learn how to write a simple plugin.

## To Use

Place the appropriate html and css onto your page. Add css that sets an explicit 
width and height for the container element. Customize the look and feel of your 
slider as desired. Apply the yetAnotherSlider function to the container element.

## Sample Use
```js
$('#slider').yetAnotherSlider();
```
